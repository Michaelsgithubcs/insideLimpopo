As a result, Dludla is now facing 14 counts of culpable homicide, along with additional charges linked to the incident.\r\n\r\nThe case has been postponed to 5 March 2026 to allow for further investigation.\r\n\r\nOutside the Vanderbijlpark Magistrates’ Court, residents from across the Vaal gathered to show solidarity with the grieving families. Community members picketed peacefully, holding placards and singing songs of support as they called for justice for the victims.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the tragedy continues to be felt deeply within local schools. Hoërskool Vanderbijlpark held a candlelight ceremony to honour three of its learners who lost their lives in the crash.

(9, 'McBride Faces Tough Questions at Ad Hoc Committee Over Alleged Abuse of Power and Collusion Claims', 'McBride’s appearance was marked by tension from the outset. Members of Parliament reprimanded him for arriving late to the proceedings, while some MPs accused him of displaying dismissive behaviour, including laughing, when allegations were raised against him. The committee also questioned McBride over his failure to update his curriculum vitae as required, to which he responded that he had not had time to do so.\r\n\r\nCentral to the hearing were claims that McBride abused his position as IPID head and acted with bias against certain SAPS officials, most notably former acting National Commissioner Khomotso Phahlane. MK Party MP David Skosana accused McBride of allowing private investigator Paul O’Sullivan, an outsider, to perform work that should have been carried out by IPID.\r\n\r\nMcBride denied the accusation, stating that O’Sullivan was neither a member of IPID nor SAPS. However, he acknowledged that information provided by O’Sullivan was credible and had assisted in initiating investigations that ultimately led to Phahlane being taken to court. McBride described O’Sullivan as “a person with resources and information.”\r\n\r\nANC MP Xola Nqola questioned whether McBride had colluded with O’Sullivan to establish a task team aimed at discrediting Phahlane and blocking his appointment as National Commissioner. McBride dismissed the claim and launched a personal attack on former IPID investigator Cedric Nkabinde, stating that Nkabinde could not be regarded as an honourable person. He further accused Nkabinde of greed, alleging that he sought money without doing the work and was obsessed with a flashy lifestyle.\r\n\r\nThe hearing also revisited allegations made by McBride regarding former Police Minister Nathi Mthethwa. MK Party MP Sibonelo Nomvalo aggressively questioned McBride about his claim that Mthethwa had hired an undocumented Zimbabwean national, Leon Mbangwa, as his chief of staff. McBride alleged that Mbangwa had no security clearance, used a fraudulent South African identity document, and had access to classified information within the Minister’s office.\r\n\r\nFurther scrutiny was placed on McBride’s credibility after he made allegations against SAPS General Nhlanhla Mkhwanazi. McBride testified about luxury handbags allegedly given as inducements to SAPS officials, including Mkhwanazi, during a trip to Paris, claiming the items were not declared. He also suggested that Mkhwanazi should be investigated for failing to attend the funeral of a close friend and for allegedly being the first person to arrive at a murder scene.\r\n\r\nHowever, MK Party MP Nomvalo challenged McBride on these claims, exposing what he described as baseless accusations made without evidence. During the proceedings, McBride stated that General Sibiya was a credible police officer, while maintaining that General Mkhwanazi was not.\r\n\r\nHonourable Thulani Shongwe questioned McBride on the credibility of various witnesses, including Lieutenant General Mkhwanazi, as the committee continued to probe inconsistencies in McBride’s testimony.\r\n\r\nThe Ad Hoc Committee hearing highlighted deep divisions and raised questions about McBride’s conduct during his tenure at IPID, with MPs from across parties expressing concern over alleged abuse of power, bias, and the credibility of serious allegations made against senior law enforcement officials.', 3, 11, 'https://www.parliament.gov.za/storage/app/media/1_Stock/misc/2026/1-january/21-01-2026/McBride_large.jpg', '2026-01-24 00:07:15', NULL, '{\"facebook\":null,\"twitter\":null,\"instagram\":null,\"linkedin\":null}'),
(10, 'Julius Mkhwanazi appears before Parliament’s Ad Hoc Committee', 'Suspended Ekurhuleni Metro Police Department (EMPD) acting chief Julius Mkhwanazi told Parliament on Thursday, 22 January 2026, that the deadly shooting outside the Booysens Magistrate’s Court had shaken his family and left him fearing for his life, after it emerged that his attorney was among the victims.\r\n\r\nMkhwanazi appeared before Parliament’s Ad Hoc Committee, where he confirmed that his lawyer—who had been assisting him at the Madlanga Commission and in other legal matters—was shot while leaving court the previous day. The shooting claimed the lives of two people and left three others injured.\r\n\r\n“My family, my kids — this thing has disturbed them,” Mkhwanazi told the committee. “My attorney, who was assisting me with the Madlanga Commission and other matters, was shot the day before while leaving court. I can’t even move out of the house. I’m being seen as the killer police.”\r\n\r\nThe shooting occurred outside the Booysens Court in Johannesburg, where three gunmen wearing caps opened fire on a group of people exiting the building. Police confirmed that two people died at the scene, while three others were wounded, including Mkhwanazi’s attorney, who was hospitalised. Authorities launched an investigation, although the motive remained unclear.\r\n\r\nUnconfirmed reports suggested the attorney may have been targeted following a consultation involving an alleged gangster earlier that day.\r\n\r\nThe incident unfolded against heightened tensions following the killing of Marius van der Merwe, also known as “Witness D,” who was shot dead on 5 December 2025. Van der Merwe had testified before the Madlanga Commission, alleging that senior EMPD officials instructed him to dispose of a murder victim’s body. He was reportedly preparing to expose alleged state involvement in illegal mining activities shortly before his death.\r\n\r\nMkhwanazi denied knowing Van der Merwe. “I do not know Witness D, and he does not know me,” he said, while confirming that he had visited the crime scene on the morning of Van der Merwe’s killing. He denied any wrongdoing.\r\n\r\nHe also rejected allegations that he had fitted blue emergency lights to vehicles linked to businessman Vusimuzi “Cat” Matlala, who is reportedly under investigation. Mkhwanazi admitted receiving R20,000 for petrol and donated vehicles for official EMPD use but denied corruption, private misuse of emergency equipment, or involvement in violence.\r\n\r\nTensions escalated during the hearing between Mkhwanazi and DA MP Ian Cameron over viral videos allegedly showing blue-light usage on private vehicles. Mkhwanazi dismissed the footage as manipulated and accused Cameron of not taking him seriously.\r\n\r\nHe further claimed that EMPD Colonel Kelebogile Thepa’s testimony before the Madlanga Commission was “all lies.”\r\n\r\nThe Booysens court shooting has renewed concerns about the safety of legal practitioners and witnesses involved in sensitive criminal investigations, as parliamentary scrutiny into alleged misconduct within Ekurhuleni policing continued.', 3, 11, '/uploads/featured_img-1769214491685-214540647.png', '2026-01-24 00:28:11', NULL, '{\"facebook\":null,\"twitter\":null,\"instagram\":null,\"linkedin\":null}'),
(11, ' Firearm Discharge Case | Julius Malema back in court for pre-sentencing', '\r\n\r\nJulius Malema, the EFF President and Commander-in-Chief, arrived at court accompanied by members of the Moshabi clan and senior party officials. Addressing supporters outside the court, Malema framed the proceedings as part of a broader political struggle.\r\n\r\n“Our living ancestors are here with us today to show support for their son, whose only crime is his love for Black people,” Malema said.\r\n\r\nTight security measures were implemented, and court proceedings were briefly disrupted as EFF supporters attempted to force their way into the magistrate’s court building. Video footage circulating online showed heightened tensions outside the venue as police sought to control the crowds.\r\n\r\nMalema was convicted in October 2025 on five counts stemming from a 2018 EFF rally, where he was found guilty of unlawfully possessing a firearm and ammunition, discharging a firearm in public, and reckless endangerment. The incident involved Malema firing a rifle into the air during the rally.\r\n\r\nDuring the pre-sentencing hearing, the defence argued for a non-custodial sentence, citing Malema’s family responsibilities, political leadership role, and willingness to perform community service. Prosecutors, however, pushed for a direct prison sentence, arguing that Malema had shown no remorse and that the offences were serious enough to warrant incarceration.\r\n\r\nThe National Prosecuting Authority indicated that Malema could face a prison sentence of up to 15 years. A custodial sentence exceeding 12 months without the option of a fine could result in Malema being barred from serving in Parliament for five years.\r\n\r\nThe court ultimately postponed the pre-sentencing proceedings to 15 April 2026, meaning Malema had not yet been sentenced as of 24 January 2026. His legal team confirmed that he intended to appeal the conviction.\r\n\r\nFollowing the court appearance, the EFF held a press briefing where Malema struck a defiant tone, saying he did not fear imprisonment or death.\r\n\r\n“Prison and death are part of the struggle,” Malema said. “The real threats facing our people are poverty, unemployment, landlessness, and the loss of dignity. This fight is about freedom.”\r\n\r\nDespite the legal uncertainty, Malema vowed to remain the voice of the oppressed, telling supporters that the outcome of the case would not deter the EFF from pursuing its political objectives.\r\n\r\nThe postponement of the case ensured that the spotlight on Malema’s legal battle would continue in the months ahead, as the country awaited a sentencing decision that could have far-reaching consequences for one of South Africa’s most polarising political figures.', 3, 11, 'https://cisp.cachefly.net/assets/articles/images/resized/0001249170_resized_juliusmalema230120261022.jpeg', '2026-01-24 00:38:41', NULL, '{\"facebook\":null,\"twitter\":null,\"instagram\":null,\"linkedin\":null}'),
(12, 'London Protest Puts South Africa—and Britain’s Role—Under the Spotlight', '\r\n\r\nAddressing the crowd, McColgan framed the protest as more than a show of solidarity with Malema. She argued it was a confrontation with Britain’s own imperial legacy and present-day economic interests in South Africa. Britain, she said, remains one of the country’s largest foreign investors, with influence “entrenched in the economy and political life of the country.” From this perspective, criticism and legal pressure directed at the EFF were portrayed not as isolated events, but as part of a broader effort to contain movements that challenge capitalist structures.\r\n\r\nThe protest drew attention to how South African politics reverberate far beyond its borders. Placards and chants linked the EFF’s calls for land redistribution and economic transformation to wider anti-imperialist struggles, a theme that has become increasingly prominent in London’s left-wing protest scene since the outbreak of multiple international conflicts. McColgan told supporters that defending Malema was “inseparable from building militant, anti-imperialist resistance at home and internationally,” a line that drew applause from the crowd.\r\n\r\nMcColgan is a familiar presence at such mobilisations. A vocal member of the Spartacist League, she regularly engages in ideological debates within the British left and trade-union milieu, including discussions around the Trade Unionist and Socialist Coalition (TUSC). Over the past year, she has also been involved in anti-genocide protests and organising activity outside London, including actions in Birmingham with groups such as Women of Resistance.\r\n\r\nHer interventions and polemics frequently appear in Trotskyist publications, notably Workers Hammer, and her name has surfaced in early-2026 editions of the Weekly Worker amid debates over strategy and sharp criticisms exchanged among socialist organisations. On the streets, she has been active in counter-demonstrations against right-wing mobilisations, positioning the Spartacist League as an uncompromising opponent of nationalism and racism.\r\n\r\nThe London rally underscored how global flashpoints continue to animate Britain’s fragmented left. While the immediate focus was South Africa, the protest’s message was aimed just as much at Westminster and the City of London: a reminder, organisers insisted, that Britain’s imperial footprint remains a live political issue—and one they intend to keep contesting on the streets.', 3, 11, '/uploads/featured_img-1769361642144-839621543.png', '2026-01-25 17:20:42', NULL, '{\"facebook\":\"https://www.facebook.com/share/v/1Cv9U3TAEW/\",\"twitter\":null,\"instagram\":null,\"linkedin\":null}'),
(13, 'Sibongile Mani Graduates With Honours, Reigniting Debate Over NSFAS Scandal', 'Mani rose to national prominence after an NSFAS payment error in 2017 saw R14 million mistakenly deposited into her student account. She went on to spend more than R800,000 on clothing, parties, and luxury items before the error was detected. In 2022, she was convicted of theft and initially sentenced to five years in prison. That sentence was later overturned on appeal and replaced with a suspended sentence and community service.\r\n\r\nNow, images and posts shared widely on X (formerly Twitter) claim Mani has completed her studies and graduated with honours from WSU, sparking intense public debate across the country. As of publication, no official statement has been issued by Walter Sisulu University, and the reports remain unconfirmed.\r\n\r\nThe news has reopened long-standing divisions over Mani’s case. Supporters argue she became a convenient scapegoat in a system riddled with large-scale corruption, noting that far bigger NSFAS-related scandals have resulted in few high-profile convictions. Critics, however, maintain that the conviction was justified and that personal accountability should not be blurred by broader institutional failures.\r\n\r\nLegal experts have previously described the case as unusual but lawful, while civil society organisations pointed to it as a stark illustration of poor financial controls and governance failures within South Africa’s higher education funding system.\r\n\r\nWhether viewed as a redemption story or an unresolved controversy, Mani’s reported graduation has once again thrust the NSFAS saga back into the national spotlight — underscoring unresolved questions about justice, inequality, and accountability in post-apartheid South Africa.\r\n\r\nThis story is developing.

Earnings', 'According to court filings, Hugo alleges that Williams failed to pay him his rightful share of income generated through The Neptunes and the group N.E.R.D., including revenue from album sales, touring, and merchandising. The lawsuit claims Hugo is owed hundreds of thousands of dollars, with potential damages ranging from $750,000 to more than $1 million.\r\n\r\nAt the center of the dispute is N.E.R.D. Music, LLC, a company formed in 2014 by Williams, Hugo, and third member Sheldon “Shay” Haley. Under the operating agreement, Williams was responsible for managing and disclosing financial information related to the company. The agreement reportedly stipulates that Williams receives 50% of touring and related income, while Hugo and Haley receive 25% each, with merchandising and trademark income split evenly among all three.\r\n\r\nHugo claims that since 2021, he has repeatedly requested access to financial records — including income, expenses, and royalty statements — but was either ignored or provided with incomplete disclosures. His legal team argues that this failure constitutes a breach of the operating agreement.\r\n\r\nThe lawsuit further alleges that Hugo has not received his proper share of royalties tied to The Neptunes’ production catalog or N.E.R.D.’s releases. As supporting evidence, Hugo claims that numerous songs are missing from his label and SoundExchange portals, suggesting unpaid or unreported earnings.\r\n\r\nOne of the most significant claims relates to N.E.R.D.’s 2017 album No One Ever Really Dies. Hugo estimates he is owed at least $325,000 from that project alone, with total unpaid earnings from the album possibly exceeding $1 million.\r\n\r\nHugo and Williams met in Virginia Beach in the late 1980s and began working together in the early 1990s, later becoming one of the most influential production teams in modern music. As The Neptunes — and later through N.E.R.D. — they shaped the sound of pop and hip-hop with a catalog of chart-topping hits spanning decades.\r\n\r\nWilliams has not publicly responded to the lawsuit at the time of publication.\r\n\r\nThe case adds to a growing list of high-profile legal disputes over music royalties and creative partnerships, raising fresh questions about transparency, control, and accountability in long-running artist collaborations.\r\n\r\nThis is a developing story.', 3, 8, '/uploads/featured_img-1769444423340-221086224.jpg', '2026-01-26 16:20:23', NULL, '{\"facebook\":null,\"twitter\":null,\"instagram\":null,\"linkedin\":null}'),

He was also criticised for not speaking isiZulu. Netshiunda remained calm throughout the confrontation, responding without raising his voice and continuing to perform his duties.\r\n\r\nColonel Netshiunda is South African-born and hails from Limpopo province. His home language is Tshivenda, one of South Africa’s official languages. His appointment in KwaZulu-Natal reflects the national character of SAPS, which deploys officers across provinces regardless of their language or place of origin.\r\n\r\nThe incident has sparked wider public debate about tribalism and discrimination. Some commentators have pointed out that for more than a decade, former KZN SAPS spokesperson Brigadier Jay Naicker served in the same role and communicated primarily in English, without facing similar public hostility over language or origin.\r\n\r\nIn a statement, SAPS strongly condemned the remarks directed at Netshiunda, describing them as discriminatory, offensive, and contrary to the values of the Constitution. The organisation emphasised that discrimination based on culture, language, or race has no place in South Africa’s democracy.\r\n\r\nSAPS further noted that KwaZulu-Natal, like all provinces, is home to people from many racial, cultural, and linguistic backgrounds. Police stations across the country are staffed by officers from diverse communities, a diversity the service says strengthens its ability to serve the public.\r\n\r\n“It is unfair and disappointing for any member of the public to treat a police officer in this manner,” SAPS said, adding that Netshiunda is a qualified and dedicated officer committed to serving all who live in the country.\r\n\r\nThe police service called on communities to promote tolerance, respect, and social cohesion, warning that tribal or cultural intolerance undermines unity and the rule of law.\r\n\r\nAs the video continues to circulate, the incident has become a reminder of ongoing challenges around identity, language, and inclusion in South Africa — a nation built on the recognition of diversity and equal citizenship.', 3, 5, 'https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTEw0jaq9_ghNFh0IEq6dN6JOZJO53FC3LNAg&s', '2026-01-29 21:08:02', NULL, '{\"facebook\":\"https://www.facebook.com/share/v/1CsnEuc7WD/\",\"twitter\":null,\"instagram\":null,\"linkedin\":null}'),

The technology will allow Rich Sparkle to deploy Lame’s likeness in multilingual content, virtual livestreams, and other digital experiences without requiring his physical presence.\r\n\r\nA digital twin, as described by industry analysts, is a data-driven simulation of a real individual. In Lame’s case, this includes facial mapping, voice identification, and behavioral modeling—an ambitious move that places the influencer at the center of a growing debate around identity, ownership, and AI commercialization.\r\n\r\nLame’s rise to global fame began in 2020, after he was laid off from a factory job in Italy. He quickly gained traction on TikTok with his silent, expressive reaction videos mocking overly complicated life hacks. His palm-out gesture and “speechless brother” persona resonated across cultures, turning him into a rare, truly global internet figure.\r\n\r\nToday, Lame commands more than 350 million followers across platforms, including over 160 million on TikTok alone, making him the app’s most-followed creator.\r\n\r\nStep Distinctive also owns Hong Kong Prosperous Sheep Corporation, a subsidiary focused on e-commerce livestreaming, supply chain management, and creator-led commercialization.

However, it found that the conduct did not meet the threshold required for impeachment.\r\n\r\nImportantly, Mbenenge was cleared of sexual harassment, bringing to a close a high-profile inquiry that has drawn intense public and legal scrutiny over standards of professional conduct within South Africa’s judiciary.\r\n\r\nThe case stemmed from a complaint by Andiswa Mengo, a judges’ secretary, whose allegations triggered a landmark tribunal process examining the boundaries of judicial ethics, power dynamics in the workplace, and accountability at the highest levels of the bench.\r\n\r\nFollowing the ruling, lawyers representing Mengo said the tribunal’s finding nonetheless vindicates her position. They argued that the outcome affirms that Mbenenge’s conduct was “improper,” even if it was not deemed severe enough to warrant his removal from office.\r\n\r\nThe tribunal’s decision underscores a critical distinction in judicial discipline: while misconduct may warrant censure or corrective measures, only gross misconduct can justify impeachment under constitutional standards.\r\n\r\nThe ruling effectively ends the proceedings against Mbenenge, confirming that he will continue serving as Judge President of the Eastern Cape. At the same time, the decision is likely to fuel ongoing debate about ethical accountability, workplace conduct, and the adequacy of existing disciplinary thresholds within the judiciary.', 3, 11, 'https://www.judgesmatter.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/judge_sm-mbenenge_0459-scaled.jpg', '2026-01-31 16:40:36', NULL, '{\"facebook\":null,\"twitter\":null,\"instagram\":null,\"linkedin\":null}'),
(20, 'BREAKING NEWS: KZN Hawks Head Removed From Office as Investigation Deepens', 'Senona confirmed on Tuesday that he was escorted out of his office and that his phones and electronic devices were confiscated, saying the move was ordered by KwaZulu-Natal Provincial Police Commissioner Lieutenant-General Nhlanhla Mkhwanazi. Senona stated that he has not received a formal suspension letter and remains uncertain about his employment status.\r\n\r\nHowever, the Hawks have indicated that Senona remains a member of the organisation, and that internal processes are under way.\r\n\r\nAllegations and Denials\r\n\r\nThe developments follow Senona’s appearance before the Judicial Commission of Inquiry into Criminality, Political Interference and Corruption in the Criminal Justice System, chaired by Judge Madlanga.\r\n\r\nAt the commission, Senona denied allegations that he deliberately shared sensitive police information with alleged criminal cartel-linked businessman Vusimuzi “Cat” Matlala, describing the claims as malicious and untrue.\r\n\r\nHowever, during testimony, Senona acknowledged that he personally sent a letter relating to the disbandment of the political killings task team to Matlala, stating that he did so on his own accord and was merely “sharing” the document. This admission appeared to contradict earlier assertions that he had not improperly shared confidential information.\r\n\r\nSenona also told the commission that while he was attempting to assist fully, he was unable to recall certain details, citing memory lapses when questioned on key issues.\r\n\r\nRelationship With Matlala Under Scrutiny\r\n\r\nEvidence Leader Advocate Matthew Hassim questioned Senona extensively about his relationship with Matlala, particularly following a 5 March 2025 News24 report detailing criminal allegations against the businessman.\r\n\r\nSenona told the commission that the article prompted him to reconsider and distance himself from Matlala, saying he had “serious deliberations” with him and began withdrawing their association. Despite this, Senona conceded that he later accompanied Matlala to a 15 April 2025 meeting with Lt. Gen Mkhwanazi.\r\n\r\nUnder questioning, Senona admitted he was aware that Matlala’s office had been raided in connection with firearms linked to his security company. However, he denied closely following media reports alleging Matlala’s involvement in criminal activities, including claims of illegal use of blue lights and other high-profile allegations.\r\n\r\nSenona stated that his WhatsApp communications with Matlala did not include media articles relating to these accusations.\r\n\r\nBabita Deokaran Questions\r\n\r\nThe commission also questioned Senona about his knowledge of Babita Deokaran, the Gauteng health department whistleblower who was murdered in 2021 after exposing corruption at Tembisa Hospital.\r\n\r\nSenona acknowledged knowing Deokaran and her role in uncovering corruption but maintained that he was not aware of any links between Matlala and the Tembisa Hospital corruption scandal.\r\n\r\nAdvocate Hassim referred to multiple media reports, including a February 2023 News24 article, which alleged Matlala’s involvement. Senona responded that he was not monitoring media coverage on the matter.\r\n\r\nCommissioner Sesi Baloyi expressed skepticism regarding Senona’s claims, noting the seriousness of the allegations and the high-profile nature of Deokaran’s murder. Deokaran was shot 12 times shortly after dropping her then 12-year-old daughter at school.\r\n\r\nUnanswered Questions\r\n\r\nSenona has stated that following his removal from office, he was followed home and now fears for his safety. SAPS leadership has not publicly commented on these claims.\r\n\r\nThe commission has recommended further investigation, and potential criminal charges have not been ruled out. It remains unclear whether Senona’s removal from office forms part of a formal disciplinary process or an interim administrative measure.\r\n\r\nAs the investigation continues, the situation highlights growing tensions within the KwaZulu-Natal policing structures and raises renewed concerns about internal accountability, political interference, and corruption within the criminal justice system.', 3, 11, '/uploads/featured_img-1769965590341-519778070.jpg', '2026-02-01 17:06:30', NULL, '{\"facebook\":null,\"twitter\":null,\"instagram\":null,\"linkedin\":null}'),

The witness, who is allegedly linked to a Big 5 cartel associate, asked to be excused from the Commission, with his lawyer citing self-incrimination fears.LIVESTREAM | Madlanga Commission continuesThey wanted a postponement pending the court decision.His attorney, Hartley Ngoato said: “Whatever he comes here and says may not change the narrative. It is more likely that he will incriminate himself in any answer that he gives.”However, the Commission was not persuaded by the witness’s argument and ruled that his testimony should continue.

It is the right thing for him and the team this week.\"Maro was out in Nigeria and arrived back in camp a day or two after everybody else. We made the decision for this game that it\'s best for him to start on the bench.\"I think he is going to have a massive impact. I also know the crowd when Maro comes to the touchline, I\'m sure he will get a big roar.\"Itoje had played every minute of England\'s last 30 Six Nations matches, but will now have to make an impact from the bench.\"Maro is good. As you would expect, he has thrown himself into the preparation here and has been a role model and an example to the other players, as he always is,\" Borthwick said.\"This squad is really building a connection and so is the understanding the players have for each other.
